-------------------------------DISTINCT-----------------------
The DISTINCT clause is used in the SELECT statement to remove duplicate rows from a result set

testdb=# select * from colors;
 id | bcolor | fcolor 
----+--------+--------
  1 | red    | red
  2 | red    | red
  3 | red    | 
  4 |        | red
  5 | red    | green
  6 | red    | blue
  7 | green  | red
  8 | green  | blue
  9 | green  | green
 10 | blue   | red
 11 | blue   | green
 12 | blue   | blue
 13 | blue   | blue
(13 rows)

testdb=# select distinct bcolor from colors;
 bcolor 
--------
 
 blue
 green
 red
(4 rows)

If you specify multiple columns, the DISTINCT clause will evaluate the duplicate based on the combination of values of these columns.
testdb=# select distinct bcolor,fcolor  from colors order by bcolor,fcolor;
 bcolor | fcolor 
--------+--------
 blue   | blue
 blue   | green
 blue   | red
 green  | blue
 green  | green
 green  | red
 red    | blue
 red    | green
 red    | red
 red    | 
        | red
(11 rows)



----------------------------------------------------DISTINCT ON--------------------------
PostgreSQL also provides the DISTINCT ON (expression) to keep the “first” row of each group of duplicates using the following syntax:

SELECT
   DISTINCT ON (column_1) column_alias,
   column_2
FROM
   table_name
ORDER BY
   column_1,
   column_2;
   
The order of rows returned from the SELECT statement is unpredictable therefore the “first” row of each group of the duplicate is also unpredictable. 
It is good practice to always use the ORDER BY clause with the DISTINCT ON(expression) to make the result set obvious.

Notice that the DISTINCT ON expression must match the leftmost expression in the ORDER BY clause.

testdb=# select distinct on(bcolor) bcolor,fcolor from colors order by bcolor,fcolor;
 bcolor | fcolor 
--------+--------
 blue   | blue
 green  | blue
 red    | blue
        | red
(4 rows)

For each unique bcolor value,it would return only the first unique bcolor it encounters based on ORDER BY clause along with fcolor value
