COPY -a mechanism for you to bulk load data in or out of Postgres.

To import entire data along with headers from csv

postgres=# copy customers from '/home/sandeepa/My Data/Sql practise/temp.csv' DELIMITER ',' csv header;
COPY 4

HEADER keyword indicates that the CSV file contains a header line with column names.
When importing data, PostgreSQL ignores the first line, which is the header line of the file.

postgres=# select * from customers;

id |   name   
----+----------
  1 | Sandeep
  2 | Sachin
  3 | Srinivas
  4 | Vivek
(4 rows)

To export data from postgres to files

postgres=# copy customers to '/home/sandeepa/My Data/Sql practise/customers.csv' delimiter ',' csv header;
COPY 4

To export only specific columns from postgres to files

postgres=# copy customers(name) to '/home/sandeepa/My Data/Sql practise/customers.csv' delimiter ',' csv header;
COPY 4
